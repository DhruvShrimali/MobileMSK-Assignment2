# MobileMSK-Assignment2
This is assignment 2 from mobileMSK (Andrew Ng courses)
Course 1  and 2 outputs are visible.
Course 3 all outputs are not visible, because the course used local .csv and .txt files,
which were not made available,so could not be read by my program.
Hence, all variables were not initialized and some functions were not working
Same problem for course 4, but I ran the jupyter notebook on the course website itself,
and included all the outputs in the same folder.

Legend:
Course 1  - ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers
Course 2  - Building Systems with the ChatGPT API
Course 3  - LangChain for LLM Application Development
Course 4  - How Diffusion Models Work
